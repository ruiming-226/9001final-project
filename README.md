This is a game that describes a person's daily state. A day can be defined as happy day, sad day, tired day, or ordinary day. The factors that determine the day's state are emotion and energy, where both emotion and energy must be greater than or equal to zero.  

When emotion plus energy is greater than or equal to 5, and emotion is at least 1, and energy is at least 1, it's a happy day. If energy is greater than or equal to 0 but less than 1, it's a tired day. If emotion is greater than or equal to 0 but less than 1, it's a sad day. If none of these conditions are met, it's an ordinary day.  

In this game, activities like basketball, computer games, music, breakfast, lunch, dinner, drink, homework, and cleaning are factors that influence emotion or energy. Want to know your current state and whether you're happy today? Come play!
